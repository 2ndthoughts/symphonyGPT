Additionaly, use the 'requirements.txt' file to update the python packages required for building and running symphonyGPT.</p>

<p>There is another README.md inside the source root folder symphonyGPT/README.md that describes the code in more detail 
and how to run the tests to experience SymphonyGPT</p>
